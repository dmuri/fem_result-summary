# FrontendMentor.io Challenge
Completed challenge with responsive design. The project is built using HTML, CSS and Figma design files.

## What I learned
During this project, I learned a lot about grid, flexbox, how to utilize variables and utility functions in CSS, and how to structure my HTML and CSS code for better readability and maintainability. This project helped me improve my skills in front-end development and gave me a better understanding of how to create responsive layouts that look great on all screen sizes.

## Things to improve
The layout isn't perfectly aligned with the targeted design. This will be something to improve on moving forward.
